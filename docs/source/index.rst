Welcome to django-ca's documentation!
=====================================

**django-ca** is a tool to manage TLS certificate authorities and easily issue and revoke certificates. It is
based `cryptography <https://cryptography.io/>`_ and `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_. It can be
used as an app in an existing Django project or stand-alone with the basic project included. Everything can be
managed via the command line via `manage.py` commands - so no webserver is needed, if youâ€™re happy with the
command-line.

Features:

* Create certificate authorities, issue and revoke certificates in minutes.
* Receive e-mail notifications of certificates about to expire.
* Certificate validation via the included OCSP responder and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
* Complete, consistent and powerful command line interface.
* Optional web interface for certificate handling (e.g. issuing, revoking, ...).
* Written in pure Python2.7/Python3.5+, using Django 1.11 or later.
